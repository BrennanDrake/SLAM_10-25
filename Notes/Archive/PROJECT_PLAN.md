# SLAM Learning Project - Comprehensive Plan

## Project Overview
Educational implementation of various SLAM algorithms, building from simple to complex approaches, with eventual integration of novel sensors and platforms.

## Completed Phases

### âœ… Phase 1: Basic Occupancy Grid Mapping (COMPLETED)

- Grid: 2000x2000 cells, 0.05m resolution (100m x 100m)
- Parameters: prob_hit=0.7, prob_miss=0.4, prob_prior=0.5

### âœ… Phase 2: Classical 2D SLAM (Hector SLAM) (COMPLETED)
**Duration**: 3 sessions (~6 hours total)
**Status**: Educational implementation complete, convergence challenges identified

#### Phase 2.1: Scan Matching Core âœ…
- Gauss-Newton optimization algorithm
- Jacobian computation for pose derivatives
- Hessian matrix building and inversion
- Pose covariance estimation

#### Phase 2.2: Map Management âœ…
- Multi-resolution occupancy grid
- Efficient map update algorithms
- Integration with Phase 1 probabilistic mapping

#### Phase 2.3: SLAM Integration âœ…
- Main HectorSlamProcessor node implementation
- TF2 pose publishing
- ROS 2 node wrapper and parameter handling
- EKF integration for pose estimation

#### Phase 2.4: Testing & Validation âœ…
- Static environment testing completed
- Identified convergence challenges
- Learned importance of robust algorithms
- **Decision**: Move forward for educational value rather than perfect implementation

**Key Learnings**:
- Scan matching is sensitive to initial conditions
- Correlative scan matching more robust than Gauss-Newton for sparse data
- Parameter tuning is critical and environment-specific
- Production systems require years of optimization

## Upcoming Phases

### ðŸš€ Phase 3: Extended Kalman Filter SLAM (NEXT)
**Target Duration**: 2-3 sessions (~6-9 hours)
**Objectives**:
- Implement EKF-based SLAM from scratch
- Understand prediction-correction cycle
- Handle landmark-based SLAM

   - Motion model with uncertainty
   - Measurement model for landmarks
   
2. **Phase 3.2**: Landmark Management
   - Landmark extraction from laser scans
   - Data association (which measurement corresponds to which landmark)
   - New landmark initialization
   
3. **Phase 3.3**: Full EKF-SLAM Implementation
   - Combined state vector [robot_pose, landmark_1, landmark_2, ...]
   - Covariance matrix management
   - Loop closure handling

### Phase 4: Particle Filter SLAM (FastSLAM)

- Implement pose graph optimization
- Use g2o or Ceres solver
- Understand loop closure detection

### Phase 6: 3D SLAM Extension
**Target Duration**: 2-3 sessions
**Hardware**: Intel RealSense D455
**Objectives**:
- Extend to 3D point clouds
- RGB-D SLAM implementation
- Compare with RTAB-Map

### Phase 7: Multi-Sensor Fusion
**Target Duration**: 3-4 sessions
**Hardware**: PN5180 RFID reader + LiDAR
**Objectives**:
- RFID landmark integration
- Sensor fusion techniques
- Novel research contribution

### Phase 8: Drone SLAM Integration
**Target Duration**: 3-4 sessions
**Hardware**: Skydio X10 platform
**Objectives**:
- Aerial SLAM implementation
- Ground-aerial map fusion
- Real-world application

## Long-term Research Goals
1. **Lifelong Learning SLAM**: Continuous map updates with confidence-based learning
2. **Novel Sensor Integration**: RFID-based SLAM for warehouse/inventory applications
3. **Multi-Robot SLAM**: Coordinate mapping between ground and aerial robots
4. **Dynamic Environment Handling**: Distinguish between static and dynamic objects

## Development Guidelines
- Each phase should be completable in 1-3 sessions (<3 hours each)
- Focus on educational understanding over perfect implementation
- Document learnings and challenges for each phase
- Use simulation/fake data first, then real robot testing
- Build upon previous phases incrementally
