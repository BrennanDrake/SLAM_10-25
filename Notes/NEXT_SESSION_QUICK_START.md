# Next Session Quick Start

## 🎯 Goal
Build a Feature Quality Monitoring System that extends RTAB-Map

## 📋 What's Ready For You

### Files Created (Skeleton):
1. ✅ `PHASE_4_PART2_PLAN.md` - Complete architecture plan
2. ✅ `AGENTIC_PROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md` - How to work with AI effectively
3. ✅ `feature_quality_monitor.py` - Skeleton with TODOs
4. ✅ `adaptive_feature_selector.py` - Skeleton with TODOs

### What You Built Today:
- ✅ `feature_detector_node.py` - Working ORB detector
- ✅ `rtabmap_d455.launch.py` - Visual SLAM system
- ✅ Complete understanding of RTAB-Map architecture

## 🚀 How to Start Next Session

### Step 1: Review (15 min)
```bash
# Read the plan
cat Notes/PHASE_4_PART2_PLAN.md

# Review your existing detector
code ros2_ws/src/visual_slam_ros/visual_slam_ros/feature_detector_node.py
```

### Step 2: Design (15 min)
- Sketch system on paper (boxes & arrows)
- Identify which component to build first (recommend: Monitor)
- List 3 questions to ask AI

### Step 3: Build (2 hours)
```bash
# Start with quality monitor
code ros2_ws/src/visual_slam_ros/visual_slam_ros/feature_quality_monitor.py

# Work through TODOs with AI assistance
# Test each function as you build it
```

### Step 4: Integrate (30 min)
- Create launch file
- Test full system
- Visualize in RViz

## 💡 First Prompt to AI

Start with:
```
"I'm ready to implement the Feature Quality Monitor. 
Let's start by defining the FeatureQualityMetrics message.
What fields should it have and why?"
```

## 📊 Success Criteria

By end of session you'll have:
- [ ] Custom ROS 2 message type defined
- [ ] Quality monitor node working
- [ ] Adaptive selector adjusting parameters
- [ ] RViz visualization showing quality
- [ ] Full understanding of system composition

## 🎓 Key Concepts You'll Learn

1. **ROS 2 Messages** - Custom data structures
2. **Node Composition** - Multi-node systems
3. **Observer Pattern** - Monitoring without coupling
4. **Feedback Control** - Adaptive systems
5. **Production Patterns** - Real-world architecture

## ⚡ Quick Commands

```bash
# Build package
cd ~/Desktop/Dev/SLAM_10-25/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select visual_slam_ros
source install/setup.bash

# Test feature detector (already working)
ros2 run visual_slam_ros feature_detector

# View visualization
ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view

# Check topics
ros2 topic list | grep feature
```

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

If stuck:
1. Check topic connections: `ros2 topic echo /your_topic`
2. Verify node is running: `ros2 node list`
3. Look at logs: `ros2 log view`
4. Ask AI: "Why isn't my subscriber receiving messages?"
