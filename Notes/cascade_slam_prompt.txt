I am working on a comprehensive SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) research project. This is a multi-phase project progressing from basic occupancy grid mapping to advanced multi-sensor fusion.

## Current Status

### Phase 1: Basic Occupancy Grid Mapping - COMPLETED âœ…
- Implemented probabilistic occupancy grid with log-odds representation
- Created ROS 2 nodes for grid generation and fake scan publishing
- Bresenham line tracing for ray casting
- Successfully tested with simulated data

### Phase 2: Classical 2D SLAM (Hector SLAM) - IN PROGRESS ðŸ”„
#### Phase 2.1: Scan Matching Core - COMPLETED âœ…
- Implemented Gauss-Newton optimization algorithm
- Jacobian computation for pose derivatives (translation & rotation)
- Hessian matrix building and pose covariance estimation
- Match score quality assessment
- Successfully compiles with ROS 2 Jazzy

#### Phase 2.2: Map Management - NEXT ðŸŽ¯
- Multi-resolution occupancy grids to implement
- Integration with Phase 1 probabilistic mapping
- Target: 1-2 sessions (~3-6 hours)

```

## Technical Context
- **ROS 2 Distro**: Jazzy on Ubuntu 24.04
- **TF2 Headers**: Require special handling (double directory structure in Jazzy)
- **Dependencies**: Eigen3 for matrix operations, TF2 for transforms
- **Algorithms**: Log-odds for numerical stability, Bresenham for ray tracing
- **Build**: `colcon build --packages-select <package> --cmake-args -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF`

## Hardware Platform
- **Primary**: TurtleBot3 with custom LiDAR configuration
- **Future Sensors**: Intel RealSense D455 (3D SLAM), PN5180 RFID reader (sensor fusion)

## Session Guidelines
- **Duration**: Target 1-3 sessions of <3 hours each per sub-phase
- **Flexibility**: Can be shorter/longer with advance notice
- **Focus**: Educational value and deep understanding over feature quantity
- **Testing**: Integration testing preferred over isolated unit tests

## Next Immediate Tasks (Phase 2.2)
1. Implement MapManager source file (map_manager.cpp)
2. Create OccupancyGridLevel class for single resolution grids
3. Adapt Phase 1 log-odds and Bresenham algorithms
4. Integrate multi-resolution framework
5. Test with Phase 1 occupancy grid data

## Key Implementation Files
- `hector_slam_custom/include/hector_slam_custom/scan_matcher.hpp` - COMPLETED
- `hector_slam_custom/src/scan_matcher.cpp` - COMPLETED
- `hector_slam_custom/include/hector_slam_custom/map_manager.hpp` - Header done
- `hector_slam_custom/src/map_manager.cpp` - TO IMPLEMENT

## Important Notes
- Scan matcher uses occupancy grid gradients, not feature extraction
- Covariance = inverse of Hessian (information matrix)
- Multi-resolution helps with both speed and convergence
- Building custom implementation for learning, not using official Hector SLAM

Please help me continue Phase 2.2: Map Management implementation, building on the completed scan matching core.
