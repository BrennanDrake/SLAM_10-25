Feature Quality Monitor Node - Phase 4 Part 2

Monitors feature detection quality and publishes metrics.
This is your FIRST COMPONENT to build next session!

Learning objectives:
1. Custom message definitions
2. Observer pattern (monitor without modifying original)
3. Real-time metrics computation
4. Production monitoring patterns

    This node will:
    1. Subscribe to feature detections
    2. Analyze spatial distribution
    3. Compute quality metrics
    4. Publish metrics for other nodes to use
    5. Log warnings when quality drops

    - Observes features without modifying feature detector
    - Loose coupling via ROS 2 topics
