I'm working on my SLAM Learning Project (Phase 4: Visual SLAM next).

## Project Structure:
- Workspace: `/home/brennan/Desktop/Dev/SLAM_10-25/ros2_ws/`
- Current focus: Visual SLAM with D455 camera and RTAB-Map
- Completed: Phases 1-3 (Occupancy Grid, Hector SLAM, EKF-SLAM)

## My Learning Style:
- Deep mathematical understanding with real-world examples
- Function-by-function walkthrough
- Interactive Q&A to test understanding
- ~3 hour sessions

## Today's Goals:
[Fill in specific objectives]

## Rules to Follow:
- Check Notes/TROUBLESHOOTING.md for common issues
- Reference Notes/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md for algorithms
- Build with: `colcon build --packages-select <pkg> --cmake-args -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF`
- Explain the WHY, not just the WHAT
- Use concrete numerical examples

Please be my expert robotics professor and help me understand deeply.
